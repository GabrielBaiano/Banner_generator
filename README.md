HTML Banner Editor
This project is a dynamic web-based tool that allows users to create and customize HTML banners with a visual drag-and-drop interface, real-time styling controls, and the ability to export the final design as an image.

Features
Customizable Banner Dimensions: Set the width and height of the banner using number inputs and sliders.

Border Radius Control: Adjust the roundness of the banner's corners.

Dynamic Background: Upload an image or GIF to serve as the banner's background, with controls for its position (X and Y).

Drag & Drop HTML Blocks:

Drag predefined HTML elements (Paragraph, Heading, List, Image) from a sidebar onto the banner.

Elements snap to the drop position.

Individual controls for each added element:

Position (X, Y): Manually adjust coordinates.

Content Editing: Edit text content for paragraphs/headings, or HTML for lists.

Font Size: Control font size with a number input and slider.

Text Color: Change the color of text elements using a color picker.

Text Formatting: Toggle Bold and Italic styles.

Image Resizing: Adjust width and height of image elements (supports px, auto, %).

Image Source: Change the image source by uploading a new file.

Lock/Unlock: Prevent elements from being dragged or edited visually on the banner.

Remove: Delete elements from the banner.

HTML Content Editor: A raw HTML textarea allows for manual editing of the banner's content. (Note: Direct manual HTML edits may interfere with the drag-and-drop system's precise positioning for elements added via blocks).

Image Export: Generate a high-quality PNG image of the customized banner using html2canvas.

Image Preview Controls:

Show/Hide the generated image.

Minimize/Restore the generated image preview.

Download the generated image.

Fixed Sidebar Menu: A sticky left-hand menu for easy access to all controls.

Tabbed Interface: Organize settings into "Design," "HTML Content," and "HTML Blocks" tabs.

Accordion Sections: Collapse and expand sections within the "Design" tab for better organization.

GitHub Link: A fixed button in the bottom-left corner linking to the project creator's GitHub profile.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure and content.

CSS3: For styling, layout (Flexbox, positioning), responsiveness, and visual effects.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactive functionalities, DOM manipulation, state management, and drag-and-drop logic.

html2canvas library: A powerful JavaScript library used to convert HTML elements into a canvas image, enabling the banner export feature.

AI Assistance
This project has significantly benefited from AI assistance throughout its development. AI was instrumental in:

Refactoring Code: Helping to restructure and optimize JavaScript logic for better readability and maintainability.

Implementing Complex Features: Guiding the implementation of advanced functionalities like the drag-and-drop system with individual element controls, and the dynamic styling.

Styling Enhancements: Providing suggestions and generating CSS snippets for various UI components, ensuring a clean and modern aesthetic.

Debugging: Assisting in identifying and resolving various bugs and inconsistencies that arose during development.

Brief Tutorial
Banner Size (Design Tab):

Use the "Largura (px)" (Width) and "Altura (px)" (Height) number inputs or sliders to adjust the main banner's size.

Borders (Design Tab):

Adjust the "Borda Arredondada (px)" (Border Radius) slider to round the banner's corners.

Background (Design Tab):

Click "Fundo (Imagem/GIF)" to upload an image from your computer.

Use "Posi√ß√£o X do Fundo" and "Posi√ß√£o Y do Fundo" sliders/inputs to adjust the background image's position.

HTML Blocks (HTML Blocks Tab):

Drag & Drop: Click and drag a "Par√°grafo," "T√≠tulo," "Lista," or "Imagem" block from the "Arraste e Solte Blocos no Banner" section onto the blue banner.

Repositioning: Once on the banner, you can click and drag the element again to reposition it.

Individual Controls: Below the draggable blocks, a "Elementos Adicionados" (Added Elements) section will appear. Each added element will have its own set of controls:

Pos X / Pos Y: Adjust the element's position manually.

Conte√∫do / Tamanho Fonte / Cor: Edit text, font size (number/slider), and color for text/heading/list blocks.
